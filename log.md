# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Motivation:

I always struggled to start projects, even throughout my degree. I feel like I didn't learn as much as I should have during that time. Now I'm taking the time to learn on my own terms, without a timeline, without comparison, and detaching myself from the results I produce. I want to learn for fun again.

### Day 0: December 17th, 2025

**Today's Progress:** Working on the Odin Project, starting my 100 days of code

**Thoughts:** I want to work through the Odin project before I start my portfolio site, at least up until the React section because I want my website to be built with React. Finding balance while working has definitely been difficult but I think that balance is key and reducing opportunities of resistance is absolutely key, in addition to sleep LOL.
