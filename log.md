# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Motivation:

I always struggled to start projects, even throughout my degree. I feel like I didn't learn as much as I should have during that time. Now I'm taking the time to learn on my own terms, without a timeline, without comparison, and detaching myself from the results I produce. I want to learn for fun again.

### Day 0: November 21, 2025

**Today's Progress:** Began the Odin Project, started my 100 days of code

**Thoughts:** I already have some experience in web development, but most of that was in high school and I haven't touched it much since. It's honestly embarassing that I don't have a portfolio website right now, but that will change very very soon. I want it to represent me and my personality well while showcasing all that I can do.

### Day 1: November 22, 2025

**Today's Progress:** Working on Odin project again, lots of practice HTML and CSS, customized my VSCode!

**Thoughts:** I think that the VSCode customization I did and some of the practice assignments I did were really helpful in rebuilding my confidence. It was small enough to be digestable but also challenging and I definitely learned a lot despite previously having some experience.
